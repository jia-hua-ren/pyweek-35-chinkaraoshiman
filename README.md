## Chinkara goat paradise

“Chinkara goat paradise” is a video game written entirely in Python3 and Pygame for the biannual game jam Pyweek (35). The theme is "In the shadows"

Ah my friends, we are all the people from team chinkaraoshiman. We have made this game for everybody to play. We made this game in one week only (includes art and music!!!). This game is about being angry that you can not buy a goat and then you discover the horrors of animal cruelty on these poor goats. Please treat our animals nicely.

## Requirements
**PLEASE USE PYGAME 2.3.0 OR ABOVE or else rect.scale will not work**

Python3 and Pygame (we used Python3.11.2 and pygame 2.3.0). We also used sys and random but those are included in Python3.

## How to run
Please go into the top directory ```pyweek-35-chinkaraoshiman``` where the README.md and main.py is in. <br />
Then do ```python3 main.py```
or ```python main.py```
but you need to use **python3.11**

## Extra tips and instructions
move character with arrow keys
move under shadow (dark blocks) and goats to hide from guards
guards will follow and make you expire if they see you and you do not hide.
pick up the key to go to next level

can skip cutscenes/text with SPACE
